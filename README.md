Scirra Construct 2 sample templates and resources

Scirra2Store.docx provides a step-by-step walkthough, with screenshots, for exporting a Windows 8 game from Construct 2 and preparing and submitting it to the Windows 8 store.

The Templates subdirectory contains sample game templates that can be easily customized and submitted to the Windows 8 store.

Each template is a .capx file that can be opened in the free version of Scirra Construct 2 Release 119 or later.  Each template contains a README.txt file in the Files folder of the project, and generally all of the steps needed to customize the template are itemized in the event sheet named CustomizeGameHere.
